## **Motivation**

While thinking about a project I seek to answer the question: "Are there days when my higher spending coincides with my lower pyhsical activity or is there a positive correlation between my increased physical activity and daily spending?" This curiosity led me to explore the relationship between my personal spending and physical activity.

This project is motivated by a desire to gain better understanding of my personal habits. By analyzing my bank account spendings and daily step counts, I aim to uncover patterns in my behaviour that I might not be consciously aware of.

## **Data Source**

I have two main sources of data:
- ** Bank Account Data **:
  Data exported from my bank account as an Excel file
- ** Step Count Data **:
